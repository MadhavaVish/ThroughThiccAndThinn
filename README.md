Path tracing using Vulkan compute shaders. A relatively naive port to the GPU of my previous CPU path tracer. 
Mostly built as a way to get more familiar with Vulkan and learn how to properly allocate and utilize resources when using Vulkan.
Camera controls and a more sophisticated scene model would be nice but I'm saving that for a future project where I don't just try to take my janky CPU path tracer
and move it to the GPU!
## Features

- Unbiased path tracer
- Fast (But probably not as fast as can be)
- TODO: wavefront path tracing
- TODO: textures
- Disney BRDF
- Vulkan Compute (I know this isn't really a feature but it was cool when I got my first vulkan project working)

## Building
- (Have vulkan installed)
- Clone
- Go to scripts and run Setup.bat
- Open the generated vs project
- Compile and enjoy
